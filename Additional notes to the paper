1.how we adjust the handover parameters using CSDnet?
  We have applied CSDnet in real-world cellular networks in China Mobile. Based on the handover parameter adjusting effect, we can support the operation 
  staff to make decision.
2.Dataset Details.
  We create the COP-KPI dataset to evaluate the model performance. It has been collected from 475 gNBs in one of the major areas of China Mobile between
  May 4, 2022 and May 26, 2022. 380 gNBs are selected for training and the remaining 95 gNBs are for testing. Each gNB collects the real data of X, Y, 
  and T with a 15-minute sampling interval. Each gNB contains 2208 pieces of data, 475 gNBS are 1048800 pieces of data. There are 23 types of the observed
  data as X, of which 8 types are X_causal, 4 types of the handover-related COPs as T, and the number of RRC-connected users as Y.Details are as follows.

3.Experiment Setting Details.
  The Causal-Stable Deconstructor module in CSDnet is a multi-head self-attention network with 12 heads and 4 hidden layers. The decoder module has causal decoder 
  and stable decoder, with 12 heads and 4 hidden layers.The hidden vector dimensions of both modules are 768. We train CSDnet for 50 epochs using the Adam optimizer 
  with a batch size of 16 and a learning rate of 5e-5.The dropout rate is set to 0.1. We implement the proposed CSDnet model with the PyTorch framework and Python3.
4.Future Work.
  In the future, we would like to do more experiments to prove the effectiveness of causal decode and stable decoder, for example, ablation study, support downstream
  tasks respectively, etc.In addition, we will explore more optimization schemes to evolve support decision into automatic decision.
